# Persistent Macros

An very simple plugin to provide extra functionality around macros. 

## ‚ú® Features

- üíæ Save named macros from registers and expose them via a command
- üîÄ Swap register positions
- üîÑ Sync macros across instances
- üîß Works with VSCode Neovim

## üì¶ Install

- üí§Lazy.nvim config

```
{
    "kensleDev/persistent-macros.nvim",
    event = "VeryLazy",
    config = function()
        local macroFileLocation = "C:\\Users\\Administrator\\.config\\macros.json"
        require('persistent-macros').setup(macroFileLocation)
    end
}
```

## üßë‚Äçüè≠  Usage

> **Before use make sure to pass the macroFileLocation to the setup function**: 

### RegToMacro

RegToMacro takes the value of a register, saves it to a local json file and makes it avalible as a command. For example:

1. Save a macro to a register using q

2. Call the reg to macro command and pass in the register and a name for the new macro:
```
:RegToMacro a MyFirstFunction
```

> **Warning! Vim expections these functions to be Pascal Case so make sure the first character of the function is uppercase**: 

3. Call the function from command mode
```
:call MyFirstFunction()
```

### RegToReg

1. Call RegToReg from command mode to swap the contents of each register
```
:RegToReg a b
```

### Sync across instances

As the plugin is driven from a external json file json file it can easily be backed up for use on other instances.

To trial different configs, update the macro file location in the setup function.
